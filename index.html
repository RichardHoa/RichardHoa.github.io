          I can do backend and frontend, though my experience is more on the
          frontend side. In the mist of vibe-coding, I find much interest in
          cybersecurity, though if you want to build AI agent, I also can do it
          (sigh...)

        <h2>Why where is no style in this website?</h2>
        <p>
          Because there is no need to, it's a website that's blazingly fast,
          work on every single browser imaginable, full accessibility feature
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is created to showcase my project, and it does just that,
          and nothing else, there is no compatibility error, no Virtual DOM
          problem, no build step, no Docker, nothing.
        </p>
        <p>But it works</p>
