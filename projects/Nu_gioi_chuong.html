      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Working with limited resources, I successfully implemented the
          necessary data structure to meet the
          <a href="https://iiif.io" target="_blank" rel="no-referrer noopener"
            >IIIF</a
          >
          standard, ensuring full compatibility with the Mirador viewer.

        <p>
          The
          <strong>International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)</strong>
          is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality digital images
          online. Its goal is to create a unified method for archives,
          libraries, and museums to store, share, and display their digital
          collections, making them more accessible and interoperable.
        </p>

        <p>
          A core part of the IIIF standard is the <strong>Image API</strong>,
          which requires a specific URL structure to request images with
          different parameters (like size, region, rotation, etc.). To meet this
          requirement without a dedicated IIIF image server, I utilized a
          <strong>GitHub repository</strong> and GitHub Pages to host the tiled
          images. This approach allowed me to structure the files and folders in
          a way that mimics the IIIF URL syntax, providing a cost-effective and
          practical solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Mirador</strong> is a highly configurable, open-source web
          viewer that is purpose-built to consume IIIF-compliant resources. It's
          used by digital libraries and scholarly institutions across the world
          to provide a rich, interactive experience for viewing and comparing
          high-resolution images and manuscripts from various collections, all
          within a single interface.
