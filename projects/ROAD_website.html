      <h1>ROAD Education project</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I built the website from complete scratch, primarily using AWS to host
        the entire site, you can visit the site through the link
        <a
          href="https://www.road.edu.vn"
          target="_blank"
          rel="no-referrer noopener"
          >road.edu.vn</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>NOTE</h2>
      <p>
        Right now the website has been transferred to wordpress.org since the
        team no longer needs an advanced website. The current state of the
        website has been edited by the team independently of me, the website you
        visit right now is no longer the work of mine
      </p>

      <h2>Technology</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React with MUI Library</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express framework</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advanced features</h2>

      <h3>Road to Uni (depreciated)</h3>
      <p>
        This feature allows students to search, pick, and choose universities
        based on different criteria. Our database covers most universities in
        Vietnam, except the area near Hanoi capital.
      </p>

      />
      <h3>STEM (depreciated)</h3>

      <p>
        This active function allows teachers to upload their STEM curriculum for
        students, as well as download materials from other teachers. The website
        includes filters that allow teachers to refine their searches based on
        different criteria, such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Grade level (10, 11, 12)</li>
        <li>High school</li>
        <li>Subject</li>
        <li>Length of the curriculum</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, teachers can use the autocomplete search feature to
        quickly find their desired files
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Enhancements</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the core features, I implemented several key improvements focused
        on performance, security, and development best practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Performance &amp; Modern Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> Optimized Largest Contentful Paint
          (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift
          (CLS) by refining asset loading strategies, reducing render-blocking
          resources, and implementing lazy loading.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Progressive Web App (PWA):</strong> Enabled app installation
          prompts by implementing PWA standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Storage:</strong> Migrated client-side data storage from
          <code>localStorage</code> to <code>IndexedDB</code> to support larger
          datasets and improve asynchronous performance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Security &amp; Data Privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Deployed strict CSP
          headers to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection
          attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSRF Protection:</strong> Secured all state-changing requests
          with anti-CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compromised Password Prevention:</strong> Integrated the
          <code>HaveIBeenPwned</code> API on the backend to block users from
          signing up with known breached passwords.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Logging:</strong> Anonymized backend logs by replacing
          sensitive data with non-identifiable UUIDs for debugging, ensuring
          user privacy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Testing &amp; Deployment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>End-to-End Testing:</strong> Built an automated testing suite
          with Cypress to validate critical user flows and prevent regressions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Staging Environment:</strong> Established a dedicated staging
          environment for comprehensive pre-deployment testing and quality
          assurance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CloudFront Stability:</strong> Build a file name filtering to
          handle AWS CloudFront's limitations for object names, ensuring file
          upload reliability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>WCAG Implementation:</strong> Systematically improved
          application accessibility by applying technical standards guided by
          the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.
        </li>
      </ul>
